# Database Schema

The current schema is created entirely through the migrations in `src/database/migrations/`.

## Tables

- `accounts`: stores ephemeral account lifecycle data, including encrypted secret material, funding metadata, expiry timestamps, and optional claim metadata.
- `claims`: stores completed claim records and references `accounts.id` through a cascading foreign key on `accountId`.
- `webhooks`: stores outbound webhook subscriptions.
- `webhook_deliveries`: stores per-delivery webhook attempts, including the subscribed webhook reference (`subscription_id`), event type, payload hash, retry count, last response details, delivery timestamp, and creation timestamp. It references `webhooks.id` with `ON DELETE CASCADE` and has a composite index on (`subscription_id`, `created_at`).
- `contract_events`: stores indexed Soroban contract events, including event type, contract address, ledger sequence, transaction hash, event payload, and creation timestamp.

## Account Status Enum

`account_status_enum` currently contains these values, in order:

`initializing`, `pending_payment`, `pending_claim`, `claiming`, `claimed`, `expired`, `failed`

## Migration Verification

`src/database/migrations.integration.spec.ts` provisions a fresh embedded PostgreSQL database, applies every migration, verifies the resulting schema matches the TypeORM entity metadata, and checks that the `claims.accountId` and `webhook_deliveries.subscription_id` foreign keys are enforced.
