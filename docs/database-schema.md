# Database Schema

The current schema is created entirely through the migrations in `src/database/migrations/`.

## Tables

- `accounts`: stores ephemeral account lifecycle data, including encrypted secret material, funding metadata, expiry timestamps, and optional claim metadata.
- `claims`: stores completed claim records and references `accounts.id` through a cascading foreign key on `accountId`.
- `webhooks`: stores outbound webhook subscriptions.
- `webhook_deliveries`: stores per-delivery webhook attempts, including the subscribed webhook reference (`subscription_id`), event type, payload hash, retry count, last response details, delivery timestamp, and creation timestamp. It references `webhooks.id` with `ON DELETE CASCADE` and has a composite index on (`subscription_id`, `created_at`).
- `contract_events`: stores indexed Soroban contract events, including event type, contract address, ledger sequence, transaction hash, event payload, and creation timestamp.

## Account Status Enum

`account_status_enum` currently contains these values, in order:

`initializing`, `pending_payment`, `pending_claim`, `claiming`, `claimed`, `expired`, `failed`

## Connection Pool Configuration

TypeORM is configured with the following pool settings in both
`src/config/database.config.ts` (NestJS runtime) and
`src/config/typeorm.config.ts` (migration CLI):

| Setting                | Value | Rationale                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `min`                  | 2     | Keeps two warm connections alive to avoid TCP + TLS + PostgreSQL auth latency on the first request after an idle period.                                     |
| `max`                  | 10    | Caps per-instance connections to leave room for other services sharing the PostgreSQL server. Aligns with a conservative PgBouncer transaction-mode default. |
| `acquireTimeoutMillis` | 3000  | Fail-fast: surface an error after 3 s if no connection becomes available rather than queuing silently, which would mask connection leaks.                    |

Settings are passed to the underlying `pg` Pool constructor via the TypeORM `extra` key.

## Pool Health Check

`GET /health` performs a live pool probe: it races a `SELECT 1` against the
`acquireTimeoutMillis` (3 000 ms) timeout and reports one of three states:

| `services.database.healthy` | `services.database.poolExhausted` | Meaning                                                         |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `true`                      | `false`                           | Normal operation                                                |
| `false`                     | `true`                            | All pool connections are in use — scale up or investigate leaks |
| `false`                     | `false`                           | Database unreachable (network, credentials, etc.)               |

Added by migration `1718100009000`. Before it, the table had only its primary
key on `id`, so every lookup that was not by `id` sequential-scanned an
append-only table (#653).

**These are provisional.** No code queries `contract_events` yet, so the index
set follows the documented access patterns rather than an `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` of
real queries. Re-validate once a consumer lands and drop whichever index earns
nothing — an unused index on an insert-heavy table is pure write amplification.
`IDX_contract_events_tx_hash` is the first to drop if ingestion throughput
becomes the constraint, since it serves human lookups rather than a hot path.

No separate single-column index on `contract_address` or `event_type` is needed:
both composites can be used as left-prefix scans for their leading column.

### contract_events retention and partitioning

`contract_events` is append-only and unbounded — nothing deletes from it, so it
grows for as long as the contract emits events. Indexes keep reads fast but do
nothing about size, and a growing table makes both `VACUUM` and index
maintenance progressively more expensive. Plan for this before the table gets
large rather than after:

1. **Retention first.** Decide how far back events must be queryable. If the
   table is a cache of on-chain data, old rows are re-derivable from Horizon or
   the Soroban RPC and do not need to live here forever. A scheduled delete by
   `ledger_sequence` (not `created_at` — ledger sequence is the authoritative
   ordering) is the simplest effective step, and `SchedulerModule` already hosts
   comparable cleanup jobs.
2. **Then partitioning, if retention is not enough.** Declarative range
   partitioning on `ledger_sequence` turns retention into `DROP TABLE` on an old
   partition instead of a bulk `DELETE` plus `VACUUM`, and lets PostgreSQL prune
   whole partitions for ledger-ranged queries. Note the trade: partitioning
   requires the partition key in the primary key, so `id` alone can no longer be
   the PK — that is a breaking migration and is why it is step 2, not step 1.
3. **Archive before either**, if events are needed for audit beyond the
   retention window: copy to object storage keyed by ledger range, then prune.

### Index design notes (EXPLAIN ANALYZE audit)

- The **composite indexes on `accounts`** use `status` as the leading column because it is a low-cardinality enum (7 values) that prunes the candidate set effectively before the timestamp column filters further. PostgreSQL can also use `IDX_accounts_status_expiresAt` and `IDX_accounts_status_createdAt` as left-prefix scans for status-only queries.
- `IDX_accounts_status` (single-column) is retained alongside the composites to support `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`-verified single-predicate queries.
- All indexes use the default B-tree access method, which supports equality, range (`<`, `>`), and `ORDER BY` optimisations.

## Migration Verification

`src/database/migrations.integration.spec.ts` provisions a fresh embedded PostgreSQL database, applies every migration, verifies:

1. The resulting schema matches TypeORM entity metadata (`schemaInSync: true`).
2. The `claims.accountId` and `webhook_deliveries.subscription_id` foreign keys are enforced (inserts with orphan UUIDs are rejected).
3. The three high-traffic composite/standalone indexes exist after migration `1718100006000`.
4. The `contract_events` table exists with the expected columns and accepts inserts after migration `1718100007000`.
