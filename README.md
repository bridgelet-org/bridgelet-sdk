# Bridgelet SDK

**Backend SDK for ephemeral Stellar account management**

**MVP Stubs**

> 🚧 **The expiresIn → expiry_ledger conversion** — needs verification or explicit documentation of where it happens
> 🚧 **Webhook coverage gaps**

## Overview

The Bridgelet SDK is a NestJS-based backend service that manages the lifecycle of ephemeral Stellar accounts. It handles account creation, claim authentication, webhook notifications, and integration with the bridgelet-core smart contracts.

## ⚠️ TEMPORARY DEVELOPMENT WORKAROUNDS (IMPORTANT)

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION BEFORE DEVELOPMENT**

The following services/imports are currently **commented out** to allow `npm run start:dev` to run without errors. These are **NOT removed** and **MUST be restored** once proper implementations exist.

### Missing Services:

1. **WebhooksService** (referenced in `src/modules/claims/providers/claim-redemption.provider.ts`)
   - **Location:** `src/modules/webhooks/` (does not exist yet)
   - **What was commented out:**
     - Constructor dependency injection (line ~25)
     - Webhook trigger for `sweep.completed` event (line ~106)
     - Webhook trigger for `sweep.failed` event (line ~137)
   - **Why:** Service implementation does not exist, causing TypeScript compilation errors
   - **Impact:** Webhook notifications will NOT fire when claims are redeemed or when sweeps fail
   - **Restoration required:** Once `WebhooksService` is implemented in `src/modules/webhooks/`, uncomment all marked sections

### How to Find Temporary Changes:

1. Search the codebase for comments containing `TEMPORARY:` to locate all commented-out code that needs restoration..

2. **Ledger Expiry Conversion**
   - `CreateAccountDto.expiresIn` (seconds) is not yet converted to
     `expiry_ledger` (u32 ledger sequence) required by the contract
   - `expiresAt` Date is currently unused in `StellarService`
   - Conversion formula: `current_ledger + (expiresIn / 5)`
3. **Sweep Authorization Signature** (`src/modules/sweeps/providers/contract.provider.ts`)
   - **Current:** `generateAuthSignature()` produces a fake 64-byte stub signature
   - **Works because:** `EphemeralAccount.verify_sweep_authorization()` in `bridgelet-core`
     is also a stub that accepts any signature (documented in bridgelet-core README)
   - **Impact:** Sweep authorization is not cryptographically enforced in development
   - **Guard:** Method throws if called outside `development` or `test` environments
   - **Required:** Real Ed25519 signing against the `SweepController`'s `authorized_signer`
     once `bridgelet-core` implements real verification.

### Status:

This is a **temporary stabilization** to enable local development and onboarding until missing implementations are complete. **No code was deleted** - all logic remains in place as comments.

## Security

Ephemeral Stellar secret keys are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM (KMS-backed envelope encryption in production). See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full encryption, key-management, and legacy-data-migration details.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** NestJS (Node.js + TypeScript)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** TypeORM
- **Blockchain:** Stellar SDK + Soroban RPC
- **API:** REST api

## Features

- Account lifecycle management (create, claim, expire)
- Claim authentication via signed tokens
- Webhook system for payment events
- Integration with bridgelet-core contracts
- Admin dashboard API endpoints

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Run database migrations
# DataSource config : src/config/typeorm.config.ts
# Migrations        : src/database/migrations/
#   1718100000000-CreateAccountsTable              (accounts table, status enum, expiredAt, metadata)
#   1718100001000-CreateClaimsTable                (claims table + FK to accounts)
#   1718100002000-AddInitializingToAccountStatus   (adds INITIALIZING to account_status enum)
#   1718100003000-CreateWebhooksTable              (webhooks table)
#   1718100004000-AddClaimingToAccountStatus       (adds CLAIMING to account_status enum)
#   1718100005000-CreateWebhookDeliveriesTable     (webhook delivery attempt log table)
#   1718100006000-AddHighTrafficIndexes            (accounts composite and range indexes)
#   1718100007000-CreateContractEventsTable        (Soroban contract event index table)

#   1718100008000-AddPartialSweepToAccountStatus   (adds PARTIAL_SWEEP to account_status enum)
#   1718100008000-CreateClaimAuditLogTable         (claim attempt audit log table)
npm run migration:run

# Start development server
npm run start:dev
```

### Regenerating the migrations folder

`src/database/migrations/` is scripted rather than hand-maintained. `scripts/generate-migrations.sh` deletes the folder and rewrites every file listed above verbatim, so the folder on disk is always reproducible from the script instead of relying on files someone created by hand.

```bash
# Recreate src/database/migrations/ from the script (prompts for confirmation)
./scripts/generate-migrations.sh

# Same, but skip the confirmation prompt (useful in CI)
./scripts/generate-migrations.sh --yes

# Skip the prompt AND overwrite uncommitted changes in the migrations folder
# (only needed when you deliberately want to discard hand-edited migrations)
./scripts/generate-migrations.sh --yes --force
```

Before deleting anything, the script runs a pre-flight `git status --porcelain` check
against `src/database/migrations/` and aborts if it finds uncommitted changes there
(modified, staged, or untracked files) — the rewrite would otherwise silently destroy
them. Commit or stash your migration work first, or pair `--yes` with `--force` to
overwrite deliberately.

This does **not** apply migrations to a database — it only (re)writes the `.ts` files. Run `npm run migration:run` afterwards as usual. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md#database-migrations) for the workflow to follow when adding a _new_ migration.

## Tests

```bash
npm test

## or to run specific tests
npm test -- test_Service_File_Name

## e.g
npm test -- sweeps.service.spec.ts
```

### Coverage

Run the full coverage report (enforces 80% minimum threshold):

```bash
npm run test:cov
```

Coverage reports are generated in the `coverage/` directory. The build will fail if any metric (branches, functions, lines, statements) falls below 80%.

The repository also includes an embedded-Postgres integration test in `src/database/migrations.integration.spec.ts` that starts a fresh PostgreSQL instance, runs all current migrations, verifies the resulting schema matches the TypeORM entities, checks the `account_status_enum` values, confirms the `claims.accountId -> accounts.id` and `webhook_deliveries.subscription_id -> webhooks.id` foreign keys are enforced, verifies the high-traffic `accounts` indexes added by migration `1718100006000`, and verifies the `contract_events` table shape.

To check coverage for a specific file:

```bash
npm test -- sweeps.service.spec.ts --coverage
```

## Automated PR Naming Checks

All pull requests are validated automatically for branch naming and PR title format.

- During the initial rollout, checks run in warning mode until **2026-02-27**.
- After that date, pull requests are blocked until naming issues are fixed.

### Branch Name Format

Accepted pattern:

`(fix|feature|test|chore|docs)/issue-NUMBER-brief-description`

Regex used by CI:

`^(fix|feature|test|chore|docs)/issue-[0-9]+-[a-z0-9-]+$`

Examples:

- `fix/issue-42-jwt-error-handling`
- `feature/issue-50-webhook-service`

`main` and `develop` are exempt for release/hotfix workflows.

### PR Title Format

Accepted pattern:

`(Fix|Feature|Test|Chore|Docs): Brief description (#NUMBER)`

Regex used by CI:

`^(Fix|Feature|Test|Chore|Docs): .+ \(#[0-9]+\)$`

Examples:

- `Fix: Handle JWT errors in TokenVerificationProvider (#42)`
- `Test: Add unit tests for ClaimLookupProvider (#43)`

### How To Fix A Branch Name

Rename your local branch and push the new branch:

```bash
git branch -m fix/issue-42-jwt-error-handling
git push origin -u fix/issue-42-jwt-error-handling
```

Then update the PR to use the renamed branch. If needed, close the old PR and open a new one from the renamed branch.

### How To Fix A PR Title

Edit the PR title directly in GitHub:

1. Open the pull request.
2. Click the title field.
3. Update it to the required format.
4. Save changes.
