## Automated PR Naming Checks

All pull requests are validated automatically for branch naming and PR title format.

- During the initial rollout, checks ran in **warning mode** until **2026-02-27**.
- Since then, enforcement is active: pull requests are **blocked** until naming issues are fixed (verified 2026-08-27; the `pr-validation.yml` workflow below still blocks on non-conforming names/titles).

### Branch Name Format

Accepted pattern:

`(<conventional-type>)/brief-description`

Regex used by CI:

`^(fix|feature|feat|test|chore|docs|refactor|ref|hotfix|release|ci|build|revert)/[a-z0-9-]+$`

Examples:

- `fix/jwt-error-handling`
- `feature/webhook-service`

`main` and `develop` are exempt for release/hotfix workflows.

### PR Title Format

Accepted pattern:

`<conventional-type>: Brief description`

Regex used by CI:

`^(fix|feature|feat|test|chore|docs|refactor|ref|hotfix|release|ci|build|revert): .+$`

Examples:

- `fix: Handle JWT errors in TokenVerificationProvider`
- `test: Add unit tests for ClaimLookupProvider`
- `feature: Implement WebhooksService`

### How To Fix A Branch Name

Rename your local branch and push the new branch:

```bash
git branch -m fix/jwt-error-handling
git push origin -u fix/jwt-error-handling
```

Then update the PR to use the renamed branch. If needed, close the old PR and open a new one from the renamed branch.

### How To Fix A PR Title

Edit the PR title directly in GitHub:

1. Open the pull request.
2. Click the title field.
3. Update it to the required format.
4. Save changes.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork locally
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:

```bash
   git checkout -b fix/jwt-error-handling
   # or
   git checkout -b feature/webhook-service
```

3. **Never push directly to `main`** - always work in a branch

## Development Workflow

### 1. Make Your Changes

- **Only modify files directly related to your issue**
- Do not refactor, rename, or "improve" code outside the scope of your task
- If you must use AI, use it cautiously and contiously.
- Touching unnecessary files makes reviews harder and increases the chance of merge conflicts
- Preserve codebase integrity by staying focused on the issue requirements

### 2. Run Tests Locally

Before submitting your PR, ensure all checks pass:

```bash
# Format check
npm run format:check

# Fix formatting (if needed)
npm run format

# Linting
npm run lint

# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- your-test-file.spec.ts

# Build verification
npm run build
```

**All of these must pass before submitting your PR.**

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, concise commit messages:

```bash
# Good examples:
git commit -m "Fix: Handle TokenExpiredError in TokenVerificationProvider"
git commit -m "Test: Add unit tests for ClaimLookupProvider"
git commit -m "Refactor: Extract Stellar address validation logic"

# Bad examples:
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
git commit -m "updates"
git commit -m "wip"
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting

- [ ] All tests pass locally (`npm run test`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Code is properly formatted (`npx prettier --check .`)
- [ ] Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Only relevant files are modified
- [ ] No commented-out code added (unless marked as `TEMPORARY:` per project conventions)
- [ ] Coverage threshold passes (`npm run test:cov`)

### PR Title Format

Use conventional commit format matching the CI title regex
`^(fix|feature|feat|test|chore|docs|refactor|ref|hotfix|release|ci|build|revert): .+$`:

```
fix: Brief description of what was fixed
test: Brief description of tests added
feature: Brief description of feature
```

**Examples:**

- `fix: Resolve JWT error handling in claims service`
- `test: Add comprehensive unit tests for ClaimRedemptionProvider`

### PR Description

Include:

1. **Issue reference**: "Closes #123" or "Fixes #456"
2. **What changed**: Brief summary of your changes 3-4 lines
3. **Testing**: Confirmation that all CI checks pass locally

**Example:**

```markdown
Closes #42

## Changes

- Added try-catch for TokenExpiredError and JsonWebTokenError in decodeClaimToken
- Errors now properly throw UnauthorizedException
- All 33 tests passing

## Testing

✅ Lint passed
✅ All tests passed (33/33)
✅ Build successful
```

## CI Pipeline

When you open a PR, our CI will automatically run:

1. **Format Check** - Ensures code follows Prettier conventions
2. **Linting** - Validates code quality and standards
3. **Unit Tests** - Runs all test suites
4. **Build Verification** - Confirms the project builds successfully

**Your PR will not be merged until all CI checks pass.**

## Code Review Process

1. Maintainers will review your PR within 48-72 hours
2. Address any requested changes promptly
3. Keep discussions focused and professional
4. Once approved, maintainers will merge your PR

## Database Migrations

`src/database/migrations/` is generated by `scripts/generate-migrations.sh`, not hand-edited. The script deletes the folder and rewrites every migration file verbatim, so the folder on disk always matches what the script defines — nobody has to recreate it by hand after a clean checkout.

```bash
# Rewrites src/database/migrations/ from scripts/generate-migrations.sh
./scripts/generate-migrations.sh --yes
```

### Adding a new migration

1. Generate the file with the TypeORM CLI as usual:

   ```bash
   npm run migration:generate -- src/database/migrations/<timestamp>-<Name>
   # or, for a hand-written migration:
   npm run migration:create -- src/database/migrations/<timestamp>-<Name>
   ```

2. Write the `up()`/`down()` logic and confirm it locally (`npm run migration:run`, `npm run migration:revert`).
3. **Add the new file's contents into `scripts/generate-migrations.sh`** as its own `cat > "$MIGRATIONS_DIR/<file>.ts" <<'MIGRATION_EOF' ... MIGRATION_EOF` block, in timestamp order, so the script stays the single source of truth for the folder.
4. Run `./scripts/generate-migrations.sh --yes` and confirm `git diff` is empty — that's your proof the script and the folder agree.
5. Update the migration list in [`README.md`](./README.md#installation) to include the new file.

> **CI enforcement:** a `migration-drift` job in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs `./scripts/generate-migrations.sh --yes` against a fresh checkout and fails the build if `src/database/migrations/` does not match the script's output. New migrations must be added to the script — never hand-created in the folder — or this check will fail.

### Notes on timestamps

TypeORM orders migrations by the numeric timestamp in the filename, falling back to filename string comparison when timestamps tie. A few existing migrations (`1718100008000-*`) share a timestamp; their run order is preserved by the script exactly as it exists today (alphabetical: `AddDeletedAtToAccountsTable`, `AddPartialSweepToAccountStatus`, `CreateClaimAuditLogTable`). **Do not renumber existing migration timestamps** — any environment that already recorded these migration names in its `migrations` table would try to re-run them under new names. Give new migrations their own, later timestamp instead.

## Important Notes

### Temporary Workarounds

The project has temporary workarounds for missing services (see README "TEMPORARY DEVELOPMENT WORKAROUNDS" section). Do not:

- Remove or uncomment `TEMPORARY:` marked code unless specifically instructed
- Attempt to implement missing services (WebhooksService) unless assigned

### Scope Discipline

**This is critical:** Contributors often feel compelled to "improve" code beyond their assigned task. Please resist this urge. Unrelated changes:

- Make PRs harder to review
- Increase risk of introducing bugs
- Delay merge time
- May cause your PR to be rejected

If you notice issues outside your scope, open a separate issue instead.

## Questions?

- Check the [README](./README.md) for project setup and architecture
- Review existing issues and PRs for context
- Open a discussion issue if you need clarification before starting work

### Keeping the migration integration test current

Whenever you add a new migration, you **must** also update `src/database/migrations.integration.spec.ts` to cover the new table, column, or index.

Checklist for every new migration PR:
- [ ] New migration file added to `scripts/generate-migrations.sh` (see above)
- [ ] `src/database/migrations.integration.spec.ts` updated to assert the new schema element exists
- [ ] `README.md` migration list updated

CI does **not** currently hard-block on a missing test update, but reviewers will request changes if this step is skipped.
