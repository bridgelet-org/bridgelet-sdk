/**
 * DataSource used by the TypeORM CLI (migration:run, migration:revert, …).
 *
 * Pool rationale (issue #516)
 * ────────────────────────────
 * • max: 10 – Caps the per-instance pool to a value that leaves headroom for
 *             other services sharing the same PostgreSQL server. See
 *             docs/deployment.md for how to size this against expected
 *             concurrent load and multiple app instances.
 * • min: 2  – node-postgres's `min` does NOT eagerly open connections at
 *             startup; it only stops the pool from closing idle connections
 *             below this floor once they exist (see `_isAboveMin` in
 *             pg-pool). It does not remove first-request connection latency
 *             on its own.
 * • connectionTimeoutMillis: 3000 – This is the real node-postgres option
 *             (previously misspelled here as `acquireTimeoutMillis`, which
 *             pg-pool silently ignores). It governs BOTH the time allowed to
 *             establish a brand-new physical connection AND, critically,
 *             how long a caller queues for an already-open connection when
 *             the pool is fully saturated. Without it set, pool exhaustion
 *             queues callers indefinitely with no error – a silent hang
 *             rather than clear backpressure. With it set, a caller that
 *             can't get a connection within 3s fails fast with
 *             "timeout exceeded when trying to connect" instead of hanging.
