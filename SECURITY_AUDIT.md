## Issue #204 — SQL Injection Audit

### Summary

All TypeORM database queries in `src/` were reviewed for SQL injection risk.

### Findings.

### Conclusion

**No SQL injection vulnerabilities found.** All runtime queries use TypeORM's parameterized query builder or repository methods that automatically parameterize inputs. Migration files contain raw SQL but use only hardcoded DDL/DML statements with no user-supplied values.

### Recommendations

- Continue using TypeORM repository methods or `createQueryBuilder` with named bindings (`:param`).
- Never interpolate user input into raw SQL strings. If raw queries are needed in the future, always use parameter placeholders.
- Add a lint rule or code review check to flag `query()` calls with string concatenation/interpolation.

## Issue #206 — Sensitive Data Leakage Audit

### Summary

All `this.logger.*` calls were reviewed for potential leakage of Stellar secret keys, JWT tokens, API keys, claim tokens, or wallet addresses.

### Findings

| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `stellar/stellar.service.ts:88`                      | `params.publicKey`          | Low      | Redacted to last 6 chars              |
| `stellar/stellar.service.ts:298`                     | `params.destination`        | Medium   | Redacted to last 6 chars              |
| `stellar/stellar.service.ts:326-328`                 | `params.contractId`         | Low      | No change (contract IDs are public)   |
| `stellar/providers/payment-monitor-provider.ts:62`   | `account.publicKey`         | Medium   | Redacted to last 6 chars              |
| `stellar/providers/payment-monitor-provider.ts:152`  | `record.from`               | Medium   | Redacted to last 6 chars              |

| `sweeps/providers/transaction.provider.ts:54`        | `params.destinationAddress` | Medium   | Redacted to last 6 chars              |
| `sweeps/providers/transaction.provider.ts:109`       | `JSON.stringify(extras)`    | Medium   | Replaced with generic error reference |
| `claims/providers/token-verification.provider.ts:51` | `tokenHash`                 | Low      | No change (hash, not token)           |

### Conclusion

No logging of raw Stellar secret keys, JWT tokens, or API keys was found. Wallet addresses (public keys starting with `G`) were found in several log statements and have been redacted to show only the last 6 characters for traceability without full exposure.

### Changes Made

- Created `src/common/utils/log-sanitizer.util.ts` with `redactAddress()` helper.
- Updated logging calls across `stellar.service.ts`, `payment-monitor-provider.ts`, `claim-redemption.provider.ts`, and `transaction.provider.ts` to redact wallet addresses.

## Issue #211 — Horizon SSE Payment Monitoring

### Summary

SSE subscription to Stellar Horizon for inbound payment monitoring is fully implemented in `src/modules/stellar/providers/payment-monitor-provider.ts`.

### Implementation Details

- Uses `server.payments().forAccount().stream()` from `@stellar/stellar-sdk`
- Opens SSE streams per ephemeral account via `watch(account)`
- On payment detection: calls `StellarService.recordPayment()` to record on contract
- Updates account status to `PENDING_CLAIM` in database
- Handles idempotency (DuplicateAsset → no-op)
- Handles non-retryable errors (TooManyPayments, InvalidAmount → FAILED)
- Restores streams for `PENDING_PAYMENT` accounts on startup (`restoreActiveStreams()`)
- Cleans up all streams on shutdown (`onModuleDestroy()`)

### Conclusion

Fully implemented with comprehensive test coverage in `payment-monitor-provider.spec.ts`.

## Issue #469 — Claim Token Generation Entropy

### Summary

Claim tokens gate real fund movement: redeeming a token moves the ephemeral
account's funds to the supplied destination. A guessed or enumerated token
lets an attacker redeem someone else's funds, so token generation must be
resistant to guessing and enumeration.

### How tokens are generated

Tokens are short-lived HWAC-signed JWTs produced by `JwtKeyRotationProvider`
(`src/common/crypto/jwt-key-rotation.provider.ts`) with `HS256`. The signature
cannot be forged without the signing secret.

### Entropy sources

1. **HMAC signature (HS256).** Without the signing secret (`JWT_SECRET`), an
   attacker cannot forge a token that verifies. This alone blocks guessing of
   _content_, but a deterministic JWT (same payload + same second) is still
   identical, and tokens are only accepted if their SHA-256 hash matches a
   stored `claimTokenHash`. The practical risk is an attacker reusing/guessing
   an issued token value.

2. **Unique random `jti` claim (added for this issue).** Every issued token now
   embeds `jti = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex')`. `crypto.randomBytes`
   is a **cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG)** —
   it is explicitly NOT `Math.random()`, which is deterministic-seeded and not
   suitable for secrets.

### Why this resists brute-force / enumeration

- The `jti` adds **256 bits of entropy** (32 bytes) unique per token. Even if
  two tokens are signed for the same `publicKey` within the same second, their
  values differ.
- To enumerate a valid token, an attacker must guess the 256-bit `jti` AND
  produce a valid HMAC signature for it, requiring the signing secret.
- Brute-forcing 2^256 values is computationally infeasible. For practical
  comparison, a 128-bit random value has ~2^128 possible values; a collision
  becomes likely only after ~2^64 (~1.8×10^19) samples.

### Implementation

- `src/modules/accounts/accounts.service.ts` — `generateClaimToken()` now adds
  the random `jti` claim.
- No change to token _length_ was required (JWT length is not the entropy
  carrier; the signed random claim is).
- Defense-in-depth: token entropy is _not_ a substitute for the rate limiting
  and failed-attempt scrutiny applied to the redemption endpoint (see the
  claims rate-limiting issue). Both layers are enforced.

### Conclusion

Token generation uses a cryptographically secure random source with 256 bits
of entropy per token. No use of `Math.random` or equivalent insecure sources
was found in the claim-token path.

## Issue #468 — Per-Integrator Account Authorization

### Summary

Prior to this change, `GET /accounts/:id` and the account list resolved an
account by id without any ownership check, so any valid API key could read any
account's details across tenants.

### Fix

- Accounts are now stamped with the owning `integratorId` at creation (from the
  authenticated `X-API-Key` - see `ApiKeyAuthGuard`).
- `GET /accounts/:id` scopes the lookup to the caller's `integratorId`. When
  the caller is not the owner the service returns `404 NotFoundException`
  rather than `403`, so an unauthorized caller cannot distinguish an existing
  account from a missing one (no existence leakage).
- Migration `1718100008500-AddIntegratorIdToAccountsTable` adds the `uuid`
  column, an index, and a foreign key to `integrators`.

### Coverage

Unit tests in `accounts.service.spec.ts` assert that cross-integrator access
returns `NotFoundException` and that `create()` stamps the `integratorId`.

## Issue #527 — Sweep Authorization Production Guard Bypass Analysis

### Threat model

The `generateAuthSignature` method in `ContractProvider` throws immediately in
`NODE_ENV=production` unless `SWEEP_SIGNING_KEY_SEED` is a valid 32-byte Ed25519 seed.
This prevents a mis-configured production deployment from sending unauthorized sweeps
using a stub/placeholder signature.

### Bypass vectors assessed

| Vector | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| `NODE_ENV` spoofing from request context | **Not possible.** `process.env` is shared and set at startup; no per-request mutation path exists in the NestJS HTTP lifecycle. |
| Setting `NODE_ENV=development` in production | **Deployment-level control.** Secrets manager injection and container configuration control env vars; a correct deployment policy prevents this. |
| Passing a 32-byte placeholder seed | The guard only checks byte length (32 bytes), not entropy. A low-entropy seed would pass the guard but produce a weak signature — acceptable given the stub contract also accepts any signature in non-production. |

### Conclusion

No practical bypass vector exists in a correctly configured deployment. The guard is a
last-line-of-defence mis-configuration detector, not a cryptographic control. Real sweep
security depends on Ed25519 signature verification in the deployed `bridgelet-core` contract.
